# 📦 Supply Chain Management Analytics

An end-to-end **Supply Chain Analytics project** developed during my **Data Analytics internship**, focused on transforming raw operational data into **actionable business insights** using **Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and SQL**.

This project analyzes **inventory performance, logistics efficiency, transportation costs, delivery reliability, and supplier performance**, and presents insights through executive-ready dashboards and storytelling-driven analysis.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Modern supply chains face challenges such as:
- High transportation and procurement costs  
- Delayed deliveries and inconsistent lead times  
- Inefficient inventory utilization  
- Uneven supplier and carrier performance  

The goal of this project is to **identify operational bottlenecks**, **optimize logistics decisions**, and **enable data-driven supply chain improvements**.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Executive dashboards, logistics performance analysis, insight storytelling  
- **Tableau** – Supply chain performance & demand analysis  
- **Excel** – Inventory analysis and operational KPIs  
- **SQL** – Data querying and transformations (to be added)

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

### 🔹 Power BI — Supply Chain Analytics

**File:** `PowerBI/Supply_Chain_Dashboard.pbix`

**Pages Included:**
1. **Executive Overview**
   - Total sales, orders, AOV, fill rate
   - Sales trends & country-wise distribution
   - Top products and carriers

2. **Logistics Performance**
   - Transportation cost by mode
   - Avg transport cost per order by region
   - Top delay-prone routes (severity-based)
   - On-time vs delayed delivery analysis
   - Supplier & carrier reliability

3. **Insights & Strategic Storytelling**
   - Demand vs fulfillment gaps
   - Route-level delay concentration
   - Cost vs delay behavior patterns
   - Strategic recommendations for optimization

**Key Questions Answered:**
- Where are delivery delays concentrated?
- Which transport modes and routes drive higher costs?
- Which carriers and suppliers perform consistently better?

---

### 🔹 Tableau — Supply Chain Management Dashboard

**File:** `Tableau/Supply_Chain_Dashboard.twbx`

**Focus Areas:**
- Stock on hand & procurement cost
- Transportation mode utilization
- % of transportation cost by mode
- Demand vs actual sales trends
- Average order value by region

**Key Questions Answered:**
- How efficiently are transport modes utilized?
- How does demand compare with actual sales?
- Which regions generate higher order value?

---

### 🔹 Excel — Inventory Analysis Dashboard

**File:** `Excel/Inventory_Analysis_Dashboard.xlsx`

**Focus Areas:**
- Top stores and products by sales
- Sales by delivery method and payment method
- Inventory value, total cost, and profit
- Customer segmentation (region, type, gender)
- Time-based sales analysis

**Key Questions Answered:**
- Which products and stores drive the most revenue?
- How do customers prefer to purchase and receive products?
- Is inventory aligned with demand patterns?

---

## 🧠 Key Insights Across the Project

- High order volume does **not always correlate** with better delivery performance  
- Transportation cost increases sharply with premium transport modes  
- Delay exposure is concentrated in a small number of routes  
- Supplier and carrier performance varies significantly by region  
- Route-level optimization provides higher ROI than demand reduction  

---

## 📌 Strategic Recommendations

- Prioritize optimization for **top delay-prone routes**
- Reallocate high-performing carriers to critical routes
- Use cost-efficient transport modes for stable regions
- Track **delay severity**, not just delay percentage
- Continuously monitor transportation cost % as a core KPI
